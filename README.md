# Rock Paper and Scissors game
------------------------------

Rock paper and scissors is a fun game that was designed to help young and adult users to play against a computer and relax. It is purely a game of luck that was designed to see if you can bit the computer while enjoying a fair play. The rules of the game are very simple and the player can get the hang of it in a few moments as it is based on the rock biting scissors, scissors biting paper, and paper biting rock. Trying to bit the computer can trigger the planning of moves and predict the opponent's next move. It should be quick but thoughtful.
